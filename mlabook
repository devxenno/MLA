preface
the text of the rules of procedure and conduct of
business in the karnataka legislative assembly has been updated
in the edition by incorporating the amendments adopted by the
house based on the recommendations of the rules committee
to rule numbers 1, 2, 7 (6), 8(4), 19(3), 26a, 31, 39(3), 42(1),
44(2), 60, 72, 142, 163, 175, 177, 201, 212, 228, 232, 239, 240,
241, 293 to 300, 307, 310 and 328.
During the conference of presiding officers held during the
year 1975 unanimous resolutions were adopted for introducing
the subject committee system with a view to oversee the activities
of the government departments so as to ensure their
accountability to the legislature. Subject committee system was
introduced in kerala legislative assembly for the first time in the
country during 1980. Later on, such subject committees were
also constituted in west bengal legislature during 1989. Taking
into consideration the report of thamba durai committee, the
functioning of subject committees in kerala legislature and west
bengal, the parliament also constituted departmentally related
subject committees during the year 1990.
The rules committee of karnataka legislative assembly
examined the question of constitution of subject committees in
karnataka legislature. The suggestions made by the hon'ble
speaker, legislative assembly and the hon'ble chairman,
legislative council after their discussions with hon'ble speaker,
lok sabha, officers of lok sabha and rajya sabha and hon'ble
speakers of kerala and west bengal legislative assemblies,
the rules committee finally recommended for constituting
departmentally related standing committees to be called as
"subject committees".
Ii
the rules committee also recommended for constitution
of a new committee called the "committee on welfare of women
and children".
The rules of procedure have been amended accordingly
to give effect to the recommendations of the rules committee in
respect of constitution of subject committees, committee on
welfare of women and children and other modifications to the
rules w. E. F. 7-9-94.
The subject committees have been constituted in
karnataka legislative assembly during 1994. Prior to the
constitution of these committees, the hon'ble speaker of the
legislative assembly and the hon'ble chairman of the legislative
council had visited the states where such committees were
functioning and discussed with the hon'ble speakers of the kerala
legislative assembly, west bengal legislative assembly and the
lok sabha and framed the rules with certain modifications and
implemented them.
The business advisory committee of the legislative
assembly in the meeting held on 4-3-1996, decided to bring
certain improvements as far as the functioning of the subject
committees of the karnataka legislature are concerned.
Likewise, the rules committee of legislature was
constituted on 5-3-1996 to review the amendments and submit a
report. This committee met on 6-3-1996 and recommended for
the amendments to the rules 294, 294(1), 294(3), 297 and 301
of the rules of procedure and conduct of business in karnataka
legislative assembly.
Iii
the report containing the recommendations of the rules
committee for implementation of the above amendments was
presented before the assembly on 7-3-1996 and put to vote and
the same was adopted. The previous subject committees
consisted of 17 members, 12 of them being nominated from the
legislative assembly and 5 from the legislative council. In view
of this, the subject committees are intended to consist of 10
members, 7 of which shall be from the legislative assembly and
3 from the legislative council.
A restriction has also been imposed vide rule 294(3) to the
effect that the chairman of the subject committees listed in the
appendices i and ii, who are nominated by the hon'ble chairman
and the hon'ble speaker, shall not be nominated for the second
time.
In rule 297, it is indicated that the subject committees
shall submit report on demand for grants within 4 weeks of the
constitution of the committee and shall not ask for any extension
of time. In rule 301, there is an amendment to the effect that the
subject committees shall not undertake study tours outside
states.
It is expected that with the incorporation of the amendments,
the subject committees would be able to function still more
effectively.
The working of the subject committees since 1994 has
been studied and it was found that there is duplication of
discussion on the budget. The functions of the subject
committees also overlap with other statutory committees. The
business advisory committee at its meeting has decided that
the government has taken vote on account only for 3 months in
iv
view of discontinuation of the subject committee. As such, the
relevant rules in the rules of procedure and conduct of
business from 293 to 304 have been deleted. In order to
accommodate more members to participate in other statutory
committees the strength of members has been increased by a
motion moved in the house on 27.3 98.
The relevant rules have been amended accordingly to give
effect to the amendments in respect of deletion of subject
committees and increase in number of the standing committees.
Motion was moved to delete rule no. 211(1) and for
substituting rule no. 370 and the same was adopted on 9th may,
1998.
Again rule 271(a), (b), 277, 288, 290 and 305 motion was
moved to increase the strength of members were amended by
moving a motion for increase of strength of members in the
standing committees on 17th april 2000.
The departmentally related subject committees were again
introduced by amending relevant rules from 293 to 300 of rules
of procedure and conduct of business of karnataka legislative
assembly by moving a motion on 27-3-2001.
Rules 293 to 300 relating to the departmentally related
subject committees were deleted vide notification no. Lga/47/
misc/2005, dated: 2.4.2005.
Based on the report of rules committee, the house
adopted on 12.03.2010 the following amendments to rules of
procedure and conduct of business of karnataka legislative
assembly.
V
in the light of the proposal of ministry of rural development
and panchayat raj, government of india to constitute a separate
committee for local bodies and panchayat raj institutions, the
11th finance committee has issued guidelines for maintenance
of accounts and audit of local bodies and panchayat raj
institutions. The rules committee after examining in detail the
functioning of committees of local bodes existing in other states
recommended to constitute a committee on local bodies and
panchayat raj institutions by inserting rule 266a in rules of
procedure and conduct of business in karnataka legislative
assembly.
Rule 30 of rules of procedure and conduct of business
is amended and in which thursday is allotted for transaction of
private members business instead of friday.
Rule 212(1) has been amended by inserting the minimum
number of members to be present in the committee meetings
and the quorum to constitute a sitting of the committee shall be,
as near as may be one-third of the total number of members of
the committee.
As per the rules of procedure and conduct of business,
a minister shall not be elected as member of the committee and
that if a member after the election to the committee is appointed
as minister shall cease to be a member of the committee. The
said rule existed in some of the committees and now the rule
has been incorporated uniformly in all the committees.
