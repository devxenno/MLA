Indian economy thrives through the means of enterprise creation as one of the prime movers of the economy. In this direction, “Make in India and Made in India” movement is integral to entrepreneurship development across the country. Therefore, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) play a vital role for strengthening the Indian economy.

MSMEs have been contributing to spreading entrepreneurial culture through business innovations. Unique feature of MSMEs is that they are widely dispersed across sectors of economy producing diverse range of products and services to meet local as well as global markets. Needless to mention that the contribution of MSME is 8 per cent of GDP, 45 per cent of manufacturing output and 40 per cent of exports of the country and uniquely they are least investment driven with high returns. Employment creation is next to agriculture, thus MSME sector has potential of tapping individuals to associate with economic activities by way of self-employemnt.

One of the priorities of our Government is the inclusive concept in enterprise creation. In this endeavour, this compilation would benefit all those entrepreneurs including first generation, women, scheduled tribes, scheduled castes, handicapped, ex-servicemen, marginalized communities, etc., for enabling them in creating enterprises.

Ministry of MSME has a number of schemes and programmes to help and assist entrepreneurs’ especially small businesses. Though ours is a dedicated Ministry for MSME, number of other Ministries in the Government of India has been supporting the cause. Leveraging information would enable prospective and existing entrepreneurs to spiral up their business prospects.

In order to appreciate, understand and utilize the compiled information, it is recommended to every entrepreneur (budding, existing), institution (Government, private) engaged in training of trainers, entrepreneurship and skill development, etc., to take advantage of this for enterprise creation. This becomes a ready reference and reckoner for everyone.

Ministry of MSME has been consistently enunciating policies resulting in enabling schemes and programmes for enhancing competitiveness of enterprises. New initiatives of the ministry and market driven economy give rise to increasing product portfolio. Various ministries extend support in the areas of skill development programmes, market development assistance, technology support, credit flow, public procurement policies, participation in exhibitions both within the country and overseas, etc.

Union Minister for MSME, Shri Kalraj Mishra has been our guiding force to the process of entrepreneurship culture creation. Further, innovative steps are being taken up to augment enterprise growth. This compilation enables the first generation entrepreneurs with lot of business ideas and thoughts who could derive full benefit in terms of minimizing their struggle to look for right source of information for their guidance. Existing entrepreneurs could plan for expansion and diversification.

Transition from micro to small and medium enterprise is a continuous process in entrepreneurial domain. This is possible by harnessing the resources and support that is prevalent and created by the Government of India through various ministries.

I solicit one and all to take full advantage of this compilation and join hands to prosper.

MESSAGE

Various Ministries and Department of Government of India have been running Schemes targeted towards MSME Sector. It has been a good initiative by our Ministry to have collated this information into a single compilation. I congratulate NIMSME (National Institute for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) for this endeavour.

Information is power. Unfortunately people for whom certain types of information are disseminated are seldom able to locate such information. MSMEs are especially handicapped because such enterprises are run essentially by the entrepreneur along with one or two close associates. Thus, unlike a large enterprise which may have designated set of personnel to scout for available information continuously MSME entrepreneur do not have that luxury. On this count also this compilation would serve a very useful purpose.

In addition to entrepreneurs belonging to micro, small and medium sector, policy makers, academics and public at large may also find this compilation useful.

I convey my best wishes.

Quenching the thirst of entrepreneurs for enterprise operations is the focus of the Ministry of MSME. With this spirit behind, the ministry has been engaged in finding solutions to the issues related to enterprise promotion and development. Ministry of MSME creates policy framework for entrepreneurship development in the country. While its arms and extended field offices are engaged in translating these policies into reality on the ground, several other ministries of Government of India are also contributing towards this direction.

In this context, it is found relevant to compile these support services and schemes offered by various other ministries for proper dissemination and use by all concerned and especially those interested in venturing their own enterprises. To sum it up, this compilation is comprehensive information on enterprise development.

I appreciate the efforts taken by ni-msme in bringing out the schemes of various ministries as compendium and strongly believe that everyone associated with the process of entrepreneurship building would take full advantage of the outcome of the compilation. Let every stakeholder take the lead and move forward to augment their enterprises.

(Surendra Nath Tripathi)

Revised CLCS has been amended as follows:
a)	Ceiling on loans under the scheme has been raised from Rs.40 lakh to Rs.1 crore
b)	Rate of subsidy has been enhanced from 12% to 15%.
c)	Admissible capital subsidy is calculated with reference to purchase price of plant and machinery, instead of term loan disbursed to the beneficiary unit.
 

d)	Practice of categorisation of MSEs in different slabs on the basis of their present investment for determining eligible subsidy has been done away with; and
e)	Operation of the scheme has been extended up to 31st March, 2007. The above revisions/ amendments were made effective from September 29, 2005.
